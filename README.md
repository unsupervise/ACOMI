# ACOMI

This code implements the multiple clustering framework introduced in [1]. This framework combines two stages: the first stage (preprocessing) consists of feature extraction from the images using a pre-trained Vision Transformer (vit) [2],  and a 
dimensionality reduction of the representation space using a PCA, this step is implemented in Python. The second stage performs a Bayesian Non-Parametric 
multiple clustering algorithm derived from [3], this step is implement in Scala.

### Run the preprocessing step: 

1. Download the Aloi the multiview image dataset ALOI [4] from:  https://aloi.science.uva.nl/

**N.B.** You should donwload the following files: half resolution (illumination direction - Illumination color - Viewing direction) and fusion the contents of the three folders. The resulting folder should be located in the preprocessing folder and named ALOI. 

2. Use the following command to perform the feature extraction step: 

```
python extractFeatures.py 
```

3. Use the following command to perform the dimensionality reduction step by keeping the 53 first principal components:

```
python reduceDimensionality.py 53
```

### Run the multiple clustering step: 

The build.sh script helps the user build the project using maven. The run.sh script launches the algorithm.
